# Website Content Strategy Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the content structure and recommendations for all pages on the Code by Leon website, based on the strategic business & marketing plan. Each page will be designed as a conversion-focused element that guides visitors from discovery to client conversation.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure

- **Homepage** (`index.html`): Hero section only, needs additional sections
- **Contact Page** (`get-started.html`): Service configurator exists and aligns with strategy
- **Navbar**: Links to #portfolio, #about, #services, #blog (anchor links, sections don't exist yet)

### Strategic Alignment Gaps

- Missing Services, Portfolio, About, and Blog sections/pages
- Navbar structure is correct but content sections need implementation
- Primary CTA needs updating to match strategic plan

## Design & Layout Consistency

### Universal Layout Pattern

All pages must follow the same 4-layer architecture design pattern used in `index.html` and `get-started.html`:

1. **Layer 1: Canvas Base** (handled by CSS - background color)
2. **Layer 2: Abstract Orbs** (purple, orange, blue gradient orbs)
3. **Layer 3: Frosted Overlay** (full-screen overlay with dot grid pattern)
4. **Layer 4: Content** (typography, cards, sections)

### Consistent Elements Across All Pages

- **Navbar**: Same structure with logo, nav links, CTA button, and theme toggle
- **Background**: Same orbs container and frosted overlay pattern
- **Typography**: Same font family (Inter), sizing, and color scheme
- **Theme Toggle**: Same theme toggle functionality on all pages
- **CTA Buttons**: Consistent styling for primary and secondary CTAs
- **Section Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins between sections

## Page-by-Page Content Strategy

### 1. Homepage (`index.html`)

#### Hero Section Updates

**Current Tagline**: "Bold websites for ambitious brands" - **KEEP AS IS**

**Action Items**:

- **Keep existing headline**: "Bold websites for ambitious brands" (no changes)
- Keep subheadline: "Websites and design that make your business look as professional as it is."
- **Update primary CTA** from "START YOUR PROJECT" to: **"Book a free 20-minute call"** (matches strategic plan)
- Secondary CTA: "View Portfolio" (keep existing)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Navigation Structure

- Consider making sections full pages instead of anchor links for better SEO
- Ensure mobile menu works correctly

### Content Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Update Homepage hero + add Services, Portfolio, About sections
2. **Phase 2**: Create dedicated Services page with full package details
3. **Phase 3**: Build Portfolio page with curated projects
4. **Phase 4**: Launch Blog with initial 3-5 posts

### Design Consistency

- **4-Layer Architecture**: All pages must use the same 4-layer design pattern:

  1. Canvas base (background color)
  2. Abstract orbs (purple, orange, blue)
  3. Frosted overlay with dot grid
  4. Content layer

- **Navbar**: Same structure and styling on all pages
- **Theme Toggle**: Consistent theme toggle functionality
- **Typography**: Same font family (Inter), sizing, and color scheme
- **Card Styling**: Use same frosted glass card styling as configurator page
- **CTA Buttons**: Consistent primary/secondary button styling
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all new sections work on mobile devices

### Conversion Optimization

- Every page should have at least one clear CTA
- **Primary CTA**: Use "Book a free 20-minute call" consistently across all pages
- Use strategic plan's recommended messaging throughout (except tagline - keep "Bold websites for ambitious brands")
- Include trust indicators (testimonials, project count, etc.)
- Make booking/contact process frictionless

### SEO Considerations

- Unique meta descriptions for each page
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Alt text for all images
- Internal linking between pages
- Blog content for ongoing SEO value
